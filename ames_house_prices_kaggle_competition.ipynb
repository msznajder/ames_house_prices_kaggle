We can see that there are several features for which `NA` does not mean that the data was not callected but rather lack of presence (e.g. `NA` in `PoolQC` variable means that there is no pool at the property which is a valuable information rather than just missing data). There are also properties represented by several columns if there are multiple types of values needed for one property (e.g. `Exterior1st` and `Exterior2nd` both represent exterior covering on house but the second is not empty only if more than one material is used in the property).

    "We can see that we have lot's of feature here! Around half of them are of `object` type and since we loaded them from csv file we assume they are text. This means that we will deal with lots of categorical data features. Of course features like `Street` has to be treated as category rather than a number value. On the other hand all area related fields will be numerical. We will have to take care of the categorical values before feeding them into machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "What is also clear here is that we have 1460 data records in our training set. Not that much in terms of training data model, but probably enough because of reach features number. Some of the features however have less (sometimes much less) values recorded which means we will also deal with missing values here. There are several strategies to deal with that based on the models solution we will arrive at and we will deal with this problem also before feeding the data to out models. Doing that we also need to remember about what we found studying data decription - some missing values are actually meaningful (again: some of them not all). Like in case of `PoolQC` variable: among all 1460 properties only 7 had swimming pools and the rest with `NaN` simply did not. Definitelly not a pool area."
